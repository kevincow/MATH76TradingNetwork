### Files
In an effort to keep our repository clean, we discounted any files that were only auxilliary. In particular, there are many files relating to data cleaning that we did not include. We felt that the following files were the most important illustrating our work: 
* ARIMA.ipynb - ARIMA model predictions 
* Final Project Math 76.ipynb - Random failures, targetted attacks, and community detection
* regressions.do - A STATA file that ran our regressions (must be viewed in STATA 17)
* trading.dta - The dataset for our regression analysis (must be viewed in STATA 17)

There is also a .csv file representing our dataset that constructed our intertemporal trading network. However, it is above 25MB (26.7MB to be exact), so it is not possible to be uploaded to github. Alternatively, it can be uploaded to google drive, so here is the link to that: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F8WlnHLhWw8vANTCk5xWuk25iFkBRG-j/view?usp=sharing.
